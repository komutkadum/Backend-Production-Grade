# Notes on database

- Wrap in try catch always - problem will arise
- Database is always in another continent - it takes time - async await

# import errors

- Use full filename with extensions when importing

# Error language

- Name your error to locate where the error originates
 ```
    console.log("MongoDB connection error", error);
